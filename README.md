# Spring Cloud Platform

## Pre-Requisites

# Installing Spring Cloud CLI

There are a variety of ways to install Spring Cloud CLI, and you can find all of them [here](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/html/getting-started.html#getting-started-manual-cli-installation).  
The easiest way, however, is to use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (requires a Mac environment).

Using Homebrew simply execute these few commands:

```bash
$ brew tap pivotal/tap
$ brew install springboot
```
This installs the Spring **Boot** CLI. After that, you need to install the Spring Cloud CLI plugin like this:

```bash
$ spring install org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-cli:2.1.0.RELEASE
```

To check the installed Spring Boot CLI version and the available Spring Cloud services you can start up locally, run the following commands:

```bash
$ spring version      # print the version of the Spring Boot CLI
$ spring cloud --list # print the available services you can start with Spring Cloud CLI
```

To bring up a service via the CLI, you can type:

```bash
$ spring cloud eureka # bring up a Eureka service registry locally.
```

For more information see the [Spring Cloud CLI documentation](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-cli/reference/html/).

# Starting or Deploying Zipkin Server

Many of the services of this project use Spring Cloud Sleuth](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-sleuth) with an integration with [Zipkin](https://zipkin.io/) to write trace logs in order to trace requests analyce latencies.

Trace logs generated by a service are sent to a Zipkin server instance expected to be running (by default) on http://localhost:9411/zipkin.
The easiest way to run a Zipkin server is to use Docker:

```bash
docker run -p 9411:9411 --name zipkinServer openzipkin/zipkin
```

This will pull and start a Zipkin server container and once it is started you can access its UI using the link http://localhost:9411/zipkin.

As services will be making requests and logging traces, you will see them in the Zipkin UI. This allows you not only to see which requests are being sent and received but also how long they took and if they were successful or not.

Note, that Spring Cloud Sleuth and Zipkin also work for message-based communication, e.g. using RabbitMQ. See the Spring Cloud Sleuth](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/spring-cloud-sleuth/2.1.3.RELEASE/single/spring-cloud-sleuth.html#_sleuth_with_zipkin_over_rabbitmq_or_kafka) documentation for details.

# Service Startup Order

Required startup order (ideally):
1. Zipkin server
2. service-registry 
3. config-server instances 
4. services (i.e. service-registry clients)

For 1. - 3. the order does not matter. They can be started in any order and will find one another.
Services need to be started last, as they will require configuration for startup coming from the config-server.

# Config Server

[Access in Browser](http://localhost:1111/service/master_or_profile)

This project was created with [Spring Cloud Config Server](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/reference/html/#_spring_cloud_config_server) using the following dependencies:

* Config Server
* Zipkin Client
* Eureka Discovery Client
* Spring Boot Actuator

Project `config-server` is a Spring Boot application that acts as a central configuration server.
It uses [Spring Cloud Config Server](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/reference/html/#_spring_cloud_config_server) to serve configurations that are stored in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/FWinkler79/SpringCloudPlatform-Configs).

- Has its own configurations (not loaded from github)
- Uses Zipkin / Sleuth to report tracing information.
- Is a Eureka client, i.e. registers itself with service registry.
- Services find / lookup config-server via Eureka.
- Allows more than one config-server instances to run and be addressed by one logical service name.
- config-server (and all its potential instances) need to start before any service that reads configuration is started.
  (See [this Spring Cloud Config issue](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-config/issues/514).)

# Service Registry

[Access in Browser](http://localhost:8761/)

This project was created with [Spring Cloud Config Server](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/reference/html/#_spring_cloud_config_server) using the following dependencies:

* Eureka Server
* Config Client
* Zipkin Client
* Spring Boot Actuator

- Currently does not use configs from config-server but brings its own.
- Startup is independent from config-server

# Reservation Service

[Access in Browser](http://localhost:2222/reservations?page=1&size=2&sort=reservationName,asc)

This project was created with [Spring Cloud Config Server](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/reference/html/#_spring_cloud_config_server) using the following dependencies:

* Spring Reactive Web
* Rest Repositories
* Spring REST Docs
* Spring Data JPA
* H2 Database
* Config Client
* Zipkin Client
* Eureka Discovery Client
* Spring Boot Actuator
* RSocket

# Diagnostics Service

[Access in Browser](http://localhost:8777/)

This project was created with [Spring Cloud Config Server](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/reference/html/#_spring_cloud_config_server) using the following dependencies:

* Eureka Discovery Client
* Zipkin Client
* Spring Boot Starter Web
* Spring Boot Actuator

Additionally references WebJars to provide static UI content.
