# Alterntatives for 'spring.cloud.config.server.git' configurations:
#
#            Alternative cloning directory - By default configs are cloned to a temp dir. 
#            If this were to be deleted while the server is running, properties would go missing.
#            Override the default behavior with your own directory.
#            basedir: /my/non-temp/dir
   
#            Multi-Landscape support - Based on the profile, pick a different Git repo of configurations.
#            That can be used to have different configs for different "landscapes", e.g. dev, test, prod.
