#            Alternative cloning directory - By default configs are cloned to a temp dir. 
#            If this were to be deleted while the server is running, properties would go missing.

#            Multi-Landscape support - Based on the profile, pick a different Git repo of configurations.
#            That can be used to have different configs for different "landscapes", e.g. dev, test, prod.
